# Introduction: 
This app is called "Light the Lamp," which is an expression used to describe the light and siren that goes off when a goal is scored in a hockey game.  The NHL season just started and I'm excited to follow my favorite teams and players.  This app enables users to navigate to all 31 National Hockey League teams and learn more information about the franchise and its current players.
